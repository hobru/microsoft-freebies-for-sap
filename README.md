## How to use this list

If you work in and around SAP — as a developer, consultant, architect or basis person — the hardest part of learning the Microsoft side is usually not the technology. It's getting a *legitimate place to try things*. Customer landscapes are off-limits, corporate tenants have trials switched off, and "can I get a budget for a sandbox?" is a conversation nobody wants to have twice.

This list solves exactly that problem. Everything here is something you can sign up for **yourself, today**, with your own identity: free tiers that never expire, time-boxed trials, and a small number of paid programs that are cheap enough to be worth it personally. Most need no credit card; the ones that do say so.

**A suggested first hour, if you're starting from zero:**

1. **[Azure free account](https://azure.com/free)** — your USD 200 of credit and the always-free services. Set a budget alert immediately.
2. **[Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)** — check your eligibility *first*, because this is the one that unlocks everything else. A renewable **Microsoft 365 E5 developer sandbox**: your own tenant, 25 user licences, Teams, SharePoint, Outlook and Office pre-provisioned with sample data. It means you can build and demo against a real tenant instead of borrowing a customer's. If you hold a Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise *standard* subscription, link it and the sandbox auto-renews for as long as that subscription lives.
3. **[Power Apps Developer Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/plan)** — free, and the only place you get premium and custom connectors without a licence. This is where an SAP OData proof of concept actually happens.
4. **[Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio)** — start the trial early, because this is where the strategic conversation is right now. It is the low-code surface where an agent meets your business process: connectors, topics, actions, and — via [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — tools that reach into an SAP system. If you only build one thing this year to show a customer, build this. Pair it with the developer tenant from step 2 and the connectors from step 3 and you have a complete, licence-free path from prompt to SAP transaction.
5. **[GitHub Copilot Free](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans)** in **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** — no card, agent mode, MCP support.
6. **An [AI playground](#3-ai-playgrounds--try-before-you-build)** — five minutes to find out whether a model can do the thing, before you build anything around it.
7. **[Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/)** — free training with hosted sandboxes, plus the [SAP on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sap/) documentation.

**Three things worth knowing before you commit time:**

- **"Free tier" usually means "free up to a monthly quantity, on a specific SKU."** It is not the same as "free service." Check the exact quantity before you deploy.
- **Eligibility rules move.** The Microsoft 365 Developer Program in particular reworked its qualification model — it is no longer open sign-up.
- **Trials that auto-enrol can bill you.** Defender for Cloud and similar services start protecting everything unless you opt out, and charge once the trial window closes. Budget alerts are not optional.

## 1. Azure & cloud infrastructure

| Offer | Type | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| [Azure free account](https://azure.com/free) | 🟡🟢 | USD 200 credit for the first 30 days, free monthly amounts of popular services for 12 months, plus a large set of always-free services. *SAP angle: enough for a small Linux VM, storage account and function app — the classic integration PoC playground.* |
| [Explore free Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-services/) | 🟢 | The searchable table of every "12 months free" and "always free" service with exact monthly quantities and SKUs. *Check this before you deploy — the SKU is the difference between a free lab and a surprise invoice.* |
| [Azure Dev/Test pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/offers/dev-test/) | 🟣 | Discounted Azure rates for non-production workloads (Visual Studio subscribers / enterprise offer). *The pragmatic way to keep a long-lived SAP demo landscape alive after the credits run out.* |
| [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) | 🟢 | Free developer tools + USD 100 credit, no credit card, academic email only. *Worth flagging to trainees and dual-study students.* |
| [SAP on Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sap/) | 🟢 | Reference architectures, deployment guides, certified configurations. *Not an "offer", but the most useful free asset here.* |

## 2. AI, agents & Copilot

| Offer | Type | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| [Azure AI Foundry / Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) | 🟡🟢 | Build, evaluate and deploy AI agents and models; usable within Azure free-account credit, several underlying services have free monthly quantities. Now branded **Microsoft Foundry** in the portal. *Where you'd prototype an agent reasoning over SAP data via OData or MCP.* |
| [GitHub Copilot Free](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans) | 🟢 | 2,000 code completions/month, agent mode in supported editors, MCP server integration, Copilot CLI. No credit card. *Works fine on CAP/Node/Java, Fiori/UI5, and Terraform for SAP landscapes.* |
| [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio) | 🟡 | Low-code agent building with connectors, topics and actions; time-limited trial from the product page. *The usual starting point for "chat with my SAP business process".* |
| [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) | 🟢 | Open protocol + open-source SDKs for exposing tools and data to AI agents. *Cheapest way to make an SAP system agent-callable — wrap an RFC, BAPI or OData entity set as a tool.* |

## 3. AI playgrounds — try before you build

No subscription, no deployment, no `az login`. These are the fastest way to sanity-check whether a model can do the thing before you write a line of integration code — and they demo well from a conference Wi-Fi connection.

| Playground | Type | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| [MAI Playground](https://playground.microsoft.ai/) | 🟡 | Microsoft AI's own limited-preview playground for new and experimental **MAI** models — currently MAI-Thinking-1 (reasoning), MAI-Transcribe-2 (speech-to-text), MAI-Voice-2 (speech generation) and MAI-Image-2.5 / 2.6 (image generation), plus a "Chatter" voice experience. Browser-based, log in to use. *Transcribe is the sleeper for SAP folks: drop in a recorded requirements workshop or a support call and get a domain-accurate transcript to feed downstream. Note it's an experimental preview — don't build a customer demo on top of it.* |
| [Microsoft AI — models overview](https://microsoft.ai/models/) | 🟢 | The catalogue behind the playground: what each MAI model is for, plus MAI-Code-1.1-Flash (the lightweight agentic coding model built into GitHub Copilot and VS Code). *Useful context when someone at TechEd asks "which model should I use for what?"* |
| [Microsoft Foundry playgrounds](https://ai.azure.com/) | 🟡🟢 | Chat, agent, image and audio playgrounds inside Foundry, sitting on a broad model catalogue. You can prompt, compare models and tune parameters before you deploy anything, then export working code. *The step up from MAI Playground when you need your own endpoint, your own data and a supported production path.* |
| [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) | 🟢 | The free consumer/web Copilot — chat, image generation and web-grounded answers, no licence needed. *Handy as a zero-friction "show me what an LLM does" opener in a workshop before you get into architecture.* |
| [Microsoft Learn sandbox exercises](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/) | 🟢 | Many Learn modules include a hosted sandbox that provisions temporary Azure resources for the exercise — no subscription of your own required. *The cheapest hands-on lab environment in this whole document.* |

> 💡 **Don't add GitHub Models.** It was a popular free playground and model catalogue, but it was fully retired on 30 July 2026 — playground, catalogue, inference API and BYOK are all gone. Microsoft points new and existing projects at Azure AI Foundry / Microsoft Foundry instead. (GitHub Copilot is a separate service and is unaffected.)

## 4. Microsoft 365 & Graph

| Offer | Type | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) | 🟢 | A free, renewable **Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription** — instant sandbox tenant, 25 user licences, pre-provisioned Teams/SharePoint/Outlook/Office and sample data. Eligibility via a Visual Studio Professional/Enterprise **standard** subscription, or via the ISV Success Program / eligible Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program tiers. Joining directly gives a 90-day renewable sandbox; linking a Visual Studio subscription makes it auto-renew. *A clean tenant for Teams apps, Graph calls and Copilot extensibility — without touching a customer's production tenant.* |
| [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) | 🟢 | Run Graph queries in the browser against sample data or your own tenant, zero setup. |
| [Microsoft 365 developer docs & Agents Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/developer/) | 🟢 | Free tooling for Teams apps, message extensions and M365 Copilot agents, including the VS Code extension. *Surface an SAP approval or PO lookup directly in Teams.* |

## 5. Low-code: Power Platform

| Offer | Type | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| [Power Apps Developer Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/plan) | 🟢 | Free dev environment for Power Apps, Power Automate and Dataverse. Open to anyone with a work/school account backed by Microsoft Entra ID. Includes **premium and custom connectors** and on-premises data gateway access. Limits: 750 flow runs/month, 2 GB database. *Premium connectors on a free plan is the headline — that's how you reach an SAP OData service. Solutions export cleanly to production later.* |
| [Create a developer environment (walkthrough)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/create-developer-environment) | 🟢 | Step-by-step provisioning, including what to do with no work account. *Use the developer environment, not your tenant's default — that's what unlocks premium/custom connectors.* |

## 6. Data & analytics

| Offer | Type | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| [Microsoft Fabric trial capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/fabric-trial) | 🟡 | 60 days of near-full Fabric — Data Factory, Data Engineering, Data Science, Real-Time Intelligence, Power BI — with up to 1 TB OneLake storage. Copilot and some AI experiences are **not** supported on trial capacity. *Long enough for a full SAP-data-to-OneLake pipeline demo.* |
| [Start a Fabric trial with a personal email](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/free-trial-account-personal-email) | 🟡 | Documented route via an Azure account + Entra ID user. *Useful when your corporate tenant has trials disabled — a common blocker.* |
| [Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/desktop) | 🟢 | Full modelling and report authoring, free on your own machine. *Connects to SAP HANA and SAP BW out of the box.* |

## 7. Identity & integration

| Offer | Type | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| [Microsoft Entra ID Free](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing) | 🟢 | User/group management, SSO to cloud apps, app registrations — included with any Azure or M365 subscription. *Everything you need to practise SAML federation with SAP IAS and OAuth 2.0 / OIDC against an SAP system.* |
| [Azure API Management — Consumption tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/api-management) | 🟢 | Free monthly allowance of API calls (see the free-services table for the current quantity). *A façade in front of an SAP OData or RFC endpoint with policy-based auth and throttling.* |
| [Azure Logic Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/) | 🟣 | Consumption-priced workflows with hundreds of connectors, including a dedicated SAP connector. *Idle workflows cost essentially nothing — ideal for event-driven SAP demos.* |

## 8. Security & threat protection

The area where SAP and Microsoft overlap most concretely — and the one that gets the least airtime at SAP events. SAP systems hold the crown jewels but traditionally give security operations teams very little visibility, which is precisely the gap these fill.

| Offer | Type | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| [Microsoft Sentinel — free trial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/billing) | 🟡 | Enable Sentinel on a Log Analytics workspace and the **first 10 GB/day ingested on the Analytics logs plan is free for 31 days** — both the Log Analytics ingestion charge and the Sentinel analysis charge are waived up to that limit. Subject to a 20-workspace limit per Azure tenant. Automation, bring-your-own-ML and data lake charges still apply. *31 days and 10 GB/day is genuinely enough to run a real SAP security proof of concept end to end.* |
| [Microsoft Sentinel solutions for SAP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/sap/solution-overview) | 🟢🟡 | Two Microsoft-owned solutions: one for **SAP applications** (business logic, application, database and OS layers) and one for **SAP BTP** (via the official audit log API) — deploy either or both. SIEM plus SOAR: detections for privilege escalation, unapproved changes, unauthorised access and misuse of sensitive transactions, with automated response playbooks that talk back to the SAP system. Certified and listed on the SAP Business Accelerator Hub for SAP ECC, Business Suite and other NetWeaver-based products (any cloud or on-premises), S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition (RISE), and hybrid estates. Extend it with SAP LogServ for RISE platform logs, partner add-ons, or the community repository on GitHub. *This is the single most SAP-specific thing Microsoft ships. The solution content is Microsoft-published; your cost is the data you ingest — which the 31-day trial above covers for a PoC.* |
| [Microsoft Defender for Cloud — Foundational CSPM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/) | 🟢🟡 | **Foundational CSPM is free**: continuous assessments, security recommendations, Secure Score and the Microsoft cloud security benchmark across Azure, AWS **and** Google Cloud — plus asset inventory, DevOps posture visibility, infrastructure-as-code security and compliance management. The paid plans (Defender CSPM, Defender for Servers, SQL, Containers, Storage…) are free for the first 30 days. *Point it at the subscription hosting your SAP VMs and you get a hardening backlog for free.* ⚠️ **Enabling it auto-enrols every resource unless you explicitly opt out, and billing starts at day 31.** |
| [Microsoft Entra ID Free](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing) | 🟢 | See [section 7](#7-identity--integration) — the free tier is where you practise SAML federation with SAP IAS and OAuth 2.0 / OIDC against an SAP system. Identity is the front door to every SAP security conversation. |
| [MSRC Security Update Guide](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide) | 🟢 | Microsoft's authoritative, free CVE and patch database, with filtering, an API and exportable data. *If you track patch cadence across an enterprise estate — and compare it with SAP Security Patch Day — this is the primary source, not a blog summary.* |
| [Microsoft Sentinel documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/) | 🟢 | Full deployment guides, KQL reference and detection content. *Heads-up worth repeating on stage: after 31 March 2027 Sentinel will no longer be supported in the Azure portal and moves entirely to the Microsoft Defender portal — plan any demo environment accordingly.* |

> 🧵 **Conversation starter for TechEd:** the April 2026 supply-chain attack on the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model showed how a compromised development component can reach into SAP BTP environments and business data. Microsoft published a Security blog walkthrough and an end-to-end attack replay showing Defender for Endpoint, Sentinel and Security Copilot detecting and responding to it — linked from the Sentinel-for-SAP overview above. It is a much better hook than a feature list.

## 9. Developer tooling

| [Explore Azure for SAP workloads (learning path)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/explore-azure-sap-workloads/) | 🟢 | Introductory path on architecting, sizing and operating SAP on Azure. |

## 11. Partner & startup programs

| Offer | Type | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| [Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program](https://partner.microsoft.com/) | 🟣 | Joining is free; benefit packages such as the Microsoft Action Pack carry a modest annual fee and bundle internal-use software, Azure credits, technical benefits and go-to-market support. *Also a qualifying route into the M365 E5 developer sandbox.* |
| [ISV Success Program](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/asset/collection/isv-success-program) | 🟣 | Development credits, technical consultations and marketplace publishing support for software vendors. Also a qualifying path for the M365 developer sandbox. |
